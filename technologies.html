    <h1>Technologies:</h1>
    <P>Big data requires exceptional technologies to efficiently process large amounts of data within the time allowed. The 2011 McKinsey Report  cites some of the appropriate technologies that include A/B testing, authentication base learning, classification, cluster analysis, data fusion and integration, genetic algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, neural networks, pattern recognition, and object detection. Anomalies, predictive modeling, regression, perspective analysis, signal processing, controlled and unsupervised learning, simulation, time series analysis and visualization. Multidimensional big data can also be represented as tensors,  which can be handled more efficiently by tensor-based computations such as multilinear partial spatial learning. Additional technologies being applied to big data include massive parallel processing databases (MPP), search-based applications, data and mining networks, distributed file systems, distributed databases, and cloud-based infrastructure (applications, storage and computing resources). and the Internet. 

    </P>
    <p>Some, but not all, MPP relational databases have the ability to store and manage petabytes of data. Implicit in the concept is the ability to load, monitor, backup, and optimize the use of large spreadsheets in an RDBMS. 

    </p>
    <p>DARPA's data analytics program targets the infrastructure of massive data sets, and in 2008 this technology came to the public with the launch of a company called Ayasdi.

    </p>
    <p>Practitioners of big data analytics are usually hostile to slower shared storage spaces,  favoring Direct Attached Storage (DAS) in all its variants from SSDs to high-capacity SATA disks housed in parallel processing nodes. If we look at the architecture of shared storage spaces SAN and NAS, we will find that it is slow, complex and expensive. These traits are incompatible with big data analytics systems that are based on system performance, infrastructure and low cost.

    </p>
    <p>Real-time or near-real-time delivery of information is one of the distinguishing characteristics of big data analysis. Thus, inactivity is avoided whenever and wherever possible. The cost of SAN in scale for analytics applications is much higher than other storage technologies.

    </p>
    <p>There are advantages as well as disadvantages to shared storage spaces in big data analytics, but big data analytics practitioners did not favor it as of 2011.
