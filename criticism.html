<p>Criticisms of the big data model come in two ways. The first stems from those who question the implications of the approach itself. The second comes from those who question the way it is currently being implemented.

<h2>Criticisms of the big data model</h2>
<p>"The big problem is that we don't know much about the underlying micro-experimental processes that give rise to typical network properties of big data."  In their critique of big data, Snijders, Matzat and Reips note that often very strong assumptions are made about mathematical properties that may not at all reflect what is actually happening at the microprocess level. Mark Graham has been widely criticized for Chris Anderson's assertion that big data will spell the end of a theory: focusing in particular on the idea that big data will always need to be placed in its social, economic and political context. Even if a company invests 8 or 9 sums of money to derive insight from information flows from suppliers and customers, only 40% of employees have skills mature enough to do so. To overcome this shortfall, "big data," however comprehensive or well-analyzed, must be supplemented by "big judgment," according to an article in Harvard Business Review.

<p>In the same context, it has been pointed out that decisions based on the analysis of big data are inevitable, "we knew it from the world as it happened in the past, or at best we know it as it is now.  By feeding it with a large number of data from previous experiences, we can algorithms to predict future development if the future is like the past. If the systems dynamics have changed in the future, the past will be a little has to say about the future. for this, it will be necessary to have a thorough understanding of the dynamics of systems, which implies the existence of the theory.  in response to To this criticism, it has been suggested that big data approaches be combined with computer simulations, such as proxy-based models. Increasingly, these models are getting better at predicting the outcome of the social complexities of even unknown future scenarios through computer simulations that rely on a set of interconnected algorithms. In addition, it uses multivariate methods that investigate the underlying structure of the data, such as factor analysis and cluster analysis, which have proven to be more useful as analytical methods than binary methods, which usually work with smaller data sets.

<h2>Big data implementation criticisms</h2>
<p>Dana Boyd has raised several concerns about the use of big data in science, but he has overlooked several principles, such as his selection of a sample of people who are too concerned about actually dealing with huge amounts of data.  This approach may bias the results in one way or another. The integration of heterogeneous data resources – some might consider it “big data” and some might not – presents enormous logistical and analytical challenges , but many researchers argue that such integrations potentially represent a promising new frontier in science.
